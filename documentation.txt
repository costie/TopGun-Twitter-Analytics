++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Introduction++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TopGun Twitter Analytics is an open source data warehouse for collecting and
analyzing Twitter topics.  A topic is made up of one or more keywords.

Tweets that match the keywords are downloaded locally, enriched with
other data sources (e.g. Bit.ly) and then stored in a "Star Schema" in
a MySQL RDBMS.

TopGun Twitter Analytics is intended to be used in the following ways: 
1. As a stand-alone Twitter analytics tool.
2. As the basis for an extended Twitter analytics tool. E.g. blending in your
   own data sources
3. As a self contained reference data warehouse to learn about and understand
   how enterprise data warehouses are built and maintained, albeit on a smaller
   scale. In particular the tool covers the following concepts:
     a) Dimensional modeling and Star Schema design and best practices
     b) ETL (Extract Transform Load) design and best practices
     g) Metadata

3. Pentaho Data Integration Community Edition 4.01 (may work on later versions)
4. A Bit.ly developer key

It is also recommended (although not strictly required) you get a GUI tool for
MySQL.  SQLyog Community Edition was used during original development.  It is
also recommended to have a Business Intelligence (BI hereon) tool. QlikView 10
was used during original development to explore and validate the data. We have
included a QlikView 10 load script which you can use with the personal edition
of QlikView 10.

Pre-requisite download locations:
1. MySQL Community Server 5.1 can be downloaded from here:

================================================================================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Installation++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Deploy the "topgun_twitter_analytics" database.  Ensure you are logged into
your MySQL server as 'root' and run the included script
"twitter_analytics_db.sql".

2. Create a new MySQL database user "topgun", choosing a secure password.
Ensure "topgun" has full privileges in the "topgun_twitter_analytics" database.

3. Create a new Pentaho Repository as a database repository in your MySQL
database. This will require performing the following steps (experienced Pentaho
users can do this as they see fit):
   a) In MySQL, create a new database calling it "topgun_repository".
   b) Start Spoon.  This should prompt you with the Repository Explorer.  If it
      does not, just hit Ctrl-R.
   c) On the top-right part of the Repository Explorer dialog, hit the green +
      button.  A new dialog should appear.
   d) Choose "Kettle database repository"
   e) Click the "New" button to create a new connection to your repository DB
   f) Create the new connection as such:
      i)    Connection Type = "MySQL"
      ii)   Access: "Native (JDBC)"
      iii)  Host Name = "localhost"
      iv)   Database Name "topgun_repository"
      v)    Port Number: "3306"
      vi)   User Name: "root"
      vii)  Password: [your root password]
      viii) Connection Name: "topgun_repository"
   g) After creating the new connection you should be back at the "Repository
      Information" dialog.  Enter the following fields as such:
      i)   Select Database Connection: [the connection you just created]
      ii)  ID: "TGTAR"
      iii) Name: "TopGun Twitter Analytics Repository"
   h) Hit "Create or Upgrade"
   i) Click "Yes" when prompted for confirmation
   j) Click "No" when prompted to do a dry run of the generated SQL.
   k) You should be back at the Repository Information dialog, click OK
   l) You should now be back at the "Repository Connection" dialog
   m) Select the repository you just created, and type in the default
      user ID and password: "Admin/admin"
   n) You are now ready to import the TopGun Twitter Analytics repository

4. In Spoon navigate to Tools->Repository->Import Repository... and choose the
   file: "PDI_topgun_repository.xml"

5. From within the Repository Explorer (Ctrl-E), open the
   twitter_analytics\RunMe job

6. From the explorer pane on the left, under Database connections, open the
   connection "twitter_analytics" and ensure you set the password for the user
   "topgun" to the correct password, which you should have configured in step 2.

7. Confirm that the "twitter_analytics" connection is working properly by
   opening its configuration and clicking the "Test" button.

8. From within a MySQL session in the "topgun_twitter_analytics" database, edit
   the following SQL query, replacing "your bitly logon" and "your bitly
   developer key" with your actual logon and developer key, respectively:

   UPDATE
     settings
   SET
     attribute_value = 'your bitly logon'
   WHERE
     attribute_id = 'BITLY_LOGIN';

   UPDATE
     settings
   SET
     attribute_value = 'your bitly developer key'
   WHERE
     attribute_id = 'BITLY_DEVKEY';

9. You can now run TopGun Twitter Analytics, and begin collecting data.  To do
   so, simply:
     a) Run Spoon
     b) Open the "TopGun Twitter Analytics Repository"
     c) Hit Ctrl-E to open the Repository explorer
     d) Browse to /twitter_analytics/ and open the job "RunMe"
     e) Hit F9 to run the job.
================================================================================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++Configuring topics and keywords+++++++++++++++++++++++
By default the topic "NOSQL" has been added with several keywords corresponding
to popular NOSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.).

If you wish to add a new topic (e.g. "vegetable gardening"), follow these simple
steps:

1. Log into your MySQL topgun_twitter_analytics database
2. Add a row to the source_topics table setting the topic_description to
   "vegetable gardening". Take note of the auto generated topic ID
3. Add keywords which pertain to vegetable gardening to source_keywords ensuring
   you set the source_topic_id to the previously generated topic ID for
   "vegetable gardening".  For example:
     a) set keywords = 'vegetable garden' and is_phrase = 'Y'.  This will ensure
        the words are searched as a phrase.
     b) set keywords = 'tomato -ketchup'.  This will ensure tweets with ketchup
        are excluded from search results)
     c) set keywords = 'eggplant'
     d) set keywords = 'vegetable garden soil'.  This will ensure tweets with
        all three words (in any order) are returned.
     e) set keywords = "potato"
4. Run the "RunMe" job from Spoon
5. Begin analyzing data from the "fact_tweets" table.

Remember, to understand what any of the data elements mean, just check the
column comment.
================================================================================
+++++++++++++++++++++++++Known Gotchas/Bugs/Issues++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. When running on 64-bit versions of Windows (e.g. Windows 7 64-bit), it is 
   recommended you install the 64-bit version of Java.  

   A 64-bit version of Java for Windows can be downloaded here:
   http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

   Alternatively, if you wish to use 32-bit Java make the following changes in
   the spoon.bat file, located in Pentaho "data_integration" director.  Change:
    FOR /F %%a IN ('java -version 2^>^&1^|find /C "64-Bit"') DO (SET /a
    IS64BITJAVA=%%a)
   
    to

    set IS64BITJAVA=0 
    FOR /F %%a IN ('java -version 2^>^&1^|find /C "64-Bit"') DO (SET /a
    IS64BITJAVA=%%a)


2. In the "RunMe" job the "Wait for Twitter rate limit to reset" occasionally
   hangs indefinitely.  The purpose of this step is to wait for Twitter's rate
   limit of 150 requests per hour to reset. The rate limit limits the number of
   user lookups (which is required to obtain Follower Count) TopGun TA can
   perform.  Therefore TopGun TA checks the rate the limit, and if it is maxed
   out, will wait until the reset time.  This should not be more than one hour.
   If the job is stuck on this step for more than an hour, the job should be
   restarted.

3. Occasionally the "Extract URLs from Tweets" step in the main "RunMe" job will
   fail due to timeouts of the longurl.org API.  This will result in the
   assignment of "staging_fact_tweets.bridge_group_referred_url" to an invalid
   row in "bridge_group_referred_urls".  It is possible to correct this by
   running the following query and re-ruruning TopGun TA:

   UPDATE
     staging_fact_tweets
   SET
     num_embedded_urls = NULL

   If you do not run this query, and TopGun TA is re-run (which is normal
   given that TopGun TA is expected to run in a continual loop) then the
   invalid assignment will persist.  However this will not prevent future Tweets
   from being downloaded and processed.

   This issue will be fixed in a future version of TopGun TA.
   
================================================================================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Command Line Automation+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TopGun Twitter Analytics should be run continually without direct user
intervention.  A simple VBS script has been included for the Windows operating
system.  It would be relatively simple to convert this script to a UNIX shell
script or a PowerShell script.

NB: The script requires the Pentaho TopGun TA repository user ID and password.
It is recommended for security reasons to derive these from user environment
variables (which you would need to create), as opposed to hard coding them in
the script itself.

The script is found in the TopGun TA package and is called:
"launch_topgun_ta.vbs"
================================================================================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Analyzing the Data++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you have no other tools, analyzing the data by way of SQL querying is one
option.

However, it is generally easier to explore the data using an interactive
"Business Intelligence" tool. If you already have a BI tool it may be worth
using that.

The in-memory tool "QlikView" by QlikTech is a relatively simple tool to
configure, as it does not rely on OLAP pre-aggregations.  A Personal
Edition is free to download, with the restriction that you cannot share
QlikView documents.  However, a load script has been provided with this package
which will allow you to very easily load the data into your own QlikView document
and from there build out interactive charts.

There are no open source analogs to QlikView.  However, there are open source BI
tools such as Pentaho Business Intelligence which are also worth exploring.
================================================================================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Additional Documentation++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TopGun TA was designed to be self-documenting, this is one of the main reasons
to use ETL tools.  They effectively provide self-documenting code.  Furthermore
it is possible to query the Pentaho repository in SQL.  For example, it is
easily possible to write a query to determine which Transformations are
responsible for writing to "staging_fact_tweets".

Furthermore, every data element has a plain English data definition associated
with it.  It is possible to query the MySQL information_schema to produce a
data dictionary.
================================================================================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++About+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The name "TopGun Twitter Analytics" makes reference to the United States Navy
Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (SFTI program), a.k.a. "TOPGUN".  The 
name alludes to decisive air power (a la Twitter, Tweets, birds, flight,
etc.) in an instructional setting.

TopGun TA is being provided as service from the not-for-profit IRMAC (Toronto
chapter of DAMA-I). Questions regarding the GNU AGPL can be e-mailed to IRMAC's
Director of Education: education@irmac.ca

The original author of TopGun TA is Neil Hepburn (serving as director of
education to IRMAC).
